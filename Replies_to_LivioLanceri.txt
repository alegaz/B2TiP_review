> - title:
> “Time Dependent CP Violation and the determination of phi_1, phi2”
> inconsistent use of capital letters, etc.; the time-dependent observables
> are in fact CP asymmetries:
> “Time-Dependent CP Asymmetries and the Determination of phi_1, phi_2”
> 
> - introduction:
> 
> (1) In the introduction the CKM triangle angles, the CP observables (asymmetries),
> and the CP asymmetry parameters extracted from a fit are quoted
> with numerical results before being explicitly defined
> and referring to tables located at the end of the chapter.
> Lines 16-28 and 50-54, reporting these results for phi_1,
> seem more appropriate for the conclusions and
> could be moved to section 1.6.
> 
> (2) One should avoid a confusion in terminology
> among “CP observables” (“CP asymmetries” a_CP),
> “CP parameters” S, A extracted from fits,
> and their CKM interpretation in terms of phi_1 and phi_2.
> (Sometimes S is called “CP asymmetry”, etc.)
> 
> (3) The introduction is supposed to be a general introduction?
> apparently the determination of phi_2 is given less emphasis
> with respect to phi_1, that has several paragraphs devoted
> to an anticipation of quantitative extrapolation results.
> 
> - section 1.2.1 (theory)
> The discussion of theoretical assumptions in different estimates
> of DeltaS is not very transparent… (for an experimentalist reader, at least)
> in particular it is not clear if some of the quoted theoretical models
> may be constrained by additional measurements.
> 
> - section 1.5.2 (experiment, B -> KS0 pi0 gamma), lines 1225-1314
> The quoted reconstruction efficiency (Table 23) and sensitivity for S, A parameters
> seem to be based only on a signal MC sample: they look unrealistic,
> since selection criteria will be probably tightened to cope with backgrounds
> and there will be dilution factors due to backgrounds in the selected sample.
> Apparently, systematic uncertainties are not included in the extrapolation.
> Are these results too preliminary to be included?
> 
> - section 1.6 (conclusions)
> The text should highlight some of the most relevant results on projected sensitivities
> from Tables 26, 27 etc.: in particular lines 16-28 and 50-54 from the introduction
> should rather be moved to the conclusions.
> The conclusions do not include any statement on the results for K0S pi0 gamma:
> is this because the analysis is too preliminary? should it be included at all?
> 
> Editing comments:
> ------------------
> - authors’ e-mail missing
> - quotation of sections, figures etc. not uniform (“see sec.”, “S. Fig”, etc)

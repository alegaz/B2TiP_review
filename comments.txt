3. Line 402
Background charmless B decays can be CP violating, but are not always
so.  I read the line like that they are always CP violating.  If it is
not the intention, please rewrite the line.

4. Line 419
I have not read the prior part of the book and I am not sure about
assumption in this book, but is there a premise that the target
integrated luminosity for these studies is 5 ab-1?  I just wondered
how the 5 ab-1 was derived and appeared here; amount of data
corresponding to the first one-year run, some other political reasons,
or some scientific reasons?

5. Line 448
Please give the definition of the "flLenSig" in the document.

6. Line 451
I am a bit curious about the PXD occupancy in this study.  If the PXD
occupancy is very high due to, for example, severe machine background,
most tracks can have "associated" PXD hit on the PXD sensor, and
therefore, requirement of an associated PXD hit to the tracks would
not work as a useful requirement.
How was the PXD occupancy was set in the study?
Another curios question: can the SVD take over the role of PXD in a
sense of the hit requirement if the PXD occupancy is very high?

7. Line 480
Please give the definition of the "Cleo Cone" in the document.

8. Line 484 and later
I understand that the threshold of any parameters should be chosen
using Sig/sqrt(Sig +Bkg).
The discussion here is somewhat different from the thing I wrote above.
Could you write a few more words that could explain the thing being
discussed here?

9. Line 545 and many other places
This question should be directed to the editors, but there are some
analyses in the book that have not been ended yet while they are
fairly stated in the book that they are incomplete.  Will the book be
submitted to the PTEP journal as is?

l.264 Only here, it is written as $b \to s c\bar{c}$, but why not
$b \to c\bar{c}s$ to become exactly same notation as other places?

l.390 Is the numerical results for the efficiency estimated by the
current simulation for B0 \to \omega K^0_S?

l.432 The s-wave non-resonant K+K- contribution is considered, but how
about f_0(980) \to K+ K-? If treatment of the non-resonant K+K-
contribution effectively takes care of f_0(980) contribution, it still
may be safe to extract phi K0 CP violation parameters, I suppose. But
even if so, such a statement should be there. 

l.443 "$\cal{O}(100)$” how much integrated luminosity for this?

Table 6, to explain selection cuts, units are missing in many places in
this table, it should be improved. 
Also, right now, PXD hit(s) is required for the tracks to reconstruct B
decay vertex, but in reality even if there is no PXD hit, as far as there
are hits in the SVD layers, those should be exploited to reconstruct B
decay vertices, I think. Do we have a plan to mention and study to
exploit SVD hits?

l.468 As for Delta_t resolution, what is exact procedure? The sigmas for
the three Gaussians are weighted average by the normalization of each
Gaussian? Or the standard deviation resulted from the determined PDF
composed as sum of three Gaussians?

l.474 “.. the different event topologies, i.e. spherical for $B\bar{B}$
events while jet-like for continuum.”

l.475 There should be references for FastBDT, Cleo Cones and KSFW.

l.476 Out of 30 variables, here only 5 variables are mentioned. What are
other 25 variables? They should be explained somewhere, in an appendix or
footnote or bibliography.

Table 8 shows the amount of estimated backgrounds, but showing background
first without seeing the expected signal yields which are currently
explained in Table 9 could be a confusing context, I think. The order of
relevant tables and corresponding context are better to be reconsidered.

l.493 To me, it is unclear whether “the number of generic $B\bar{B}$ events
passing the selection” means that the background coming from $B\bar{B}$ or
generic $B\bar{B}$ containing the signal B decay mode. If the background
coming from $B\bar{B}$ is discussed here, it should be written as
“$B\bar{B}$ background”.

l.497-l.499 As for B -> phi K* background, even if there is no complete MC
studies right now, it has already been considered in the published Belle
analysis, there must be a possible existent treatment. I prefer to mention
about that than saying that "further studies will be needed”.

l.514 I am afraid “toy MC” is a Belle(-II) jargon. “ensemble test” may be
a common expression, I think. Accordingly, I suggest;

l.515 "To estimate the sensitivity of the analysis, we performed an ensemble
test with 1 ab$^{-1}$ and 5 ab$^{-1}$ equivalent Monte Carlo (MC) samples.
For the signal, SXF and non-resonant events, the full MC simulation is used
and combinatorial and $B\bar{B}$ background events are generated by the
parameters of each corresponding pdf determined by the fully simulated
generic MC datasets.” 

l.521 “.. we performed 1000 pseudo-experiments.”

l.522-l.523 “verify” is repeatedly used many times, it is preferable to
improve expressions, for example, “We confirm that the fit can return
unbiased results about the signal for both scalar and vector components as
well as background yields. To perform the test under an extreme condition,
we studied the case with opposite values of $S$ for the signal (+0.7) and
for the non-resonant component (-0.7). We find these two components are
correctly separated and the obtained $CP$ violation parameters are
consistent with inputs. We also see that the dependence of the uncertainty ..”

In Table 9 and its caption, “The efficiency $\varepsilon_{\rm reco}$”. Here,
with citing Belle and BaBar papers, the expected phi KL yield is better to
be stated, i.e. it sounds odd only CP violation parameters' uncertainties
are written for KS and KL combination.

Please add a couple of words here why the [25] is quoted here.

2. Line 178
The alignment constants of the vertex detector should primarily
obtained from cosmic ray tracks taken in dedicated cosmic ray runs.  I
did not fully understand what the "using control samples" would mean.

l.206 Strictly speaking, at least $B_d \to D^{(*)} \bar{D}^{(*)}$ is

Stefano, Alessandro:
---------------------
10. Line 600
It is not very trivial to me why the strategy B is the "best" since
both the strategies A and C also have advantage to the others.  I
suggest to write a bit more words here about the discussion why the
strategy B was favored.

11. Line 603
It is said that the Ks reconstruction efficiency (and hence, that of
the modes including Ks) will be improved in Belle II because the lever
arm of the Belle II vertex detector ls larger than Belle.  It seems
the statement here is inconsistent to the thing said so far.  Does the
sentence really mean the Ks reconstruction efficiency will not improve
so much?  If so, do you have idea about what prevents the improvement?

12. Line 639
It would be useful for readers to have information about first, second
and third Gaussian (mu, sigma, and fraction) rather then the overall
standard deviation values.

Table 10, unit should be written in roman font, for example not $GeV$
but GeV (or {\rm GeV}).

l.555-l.556 “The invariant mass requirements, .. efficiently reduce the
combinatoric backgrounds.” To me, this sentence is uneasy to understand
what is being said. 

l.566 In order to reject beam-background originated ECL clusters, it is
necessary to apply a proper timing cut to select clusters. Is it applied?
If yes and it is described in the reconstruction chapter, such sentences
should be referenced. 

l.570 “.. cross-feed signal candidates.” while in the phi K0 section, the
wording of “SXF: self cross-feed” is used, could you consider to use the
unified terminology throughout the paper?

l.579 “a multi-variable algorithm (BDT)” while in the phi K0 section, the
wording of “a FastBDT multivariable discriminator” is used. If the same
software utility is used for both phi K0 and eta’ K0, could you consider
to use the unified terminology throughout the paper?

l.582-l.592 Usually, the strategy A is taken, where only one best candidate
is selected in the event is selected, and the likelihood function is the
product of probability density over the candidate events. Then, if you
retain multiple candidates in one event mentioned as strategy B or C, the
principal question must be raised; it sounds that multiple candidate events
are duplicately counted in the fit. I am afraid I can not agree that it is
doing a correct thing to perform an unbinned maximum likelihood fit. 

Fig.8 right, why SXF component is not indicated?

Fig.8 caption last line, $\eta(\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0) K^0_S(\pi^{\pm})$ is
correct, isn’t it?

Table 12 does "$B\bar{B}$" mean $B^0\bar{B}^0$ ?

l.634 $J/\psi \to \mu^+ \mu^-$

l.635 “tri-gaussian” but in Fig. 6 caption “three-gaussian”, could you
consider to use the unified terminology throughout the paper?

l.639-l.642, Table 13, unit should be roman font, not $ps$ but ps. 

Table 13 caption, it is better to state that iptube constraint and KS
direction are exploited to get these results. 

l.649 again I am afraid “toy MC” may be a jargon.

l.655 “the signal cross feed” could you consider to use the unified
terminology throughout the paper?

l.679 how is it confirmed that vertex reconstruction related systematic
uncertainty can be reduced down to half with respect to the existent
published results?

Fernando:
----------
13. Paragraph starting from Line 965
Unfortunately, I could not get the meaning of the paragraph because
the explanation is geometrically very complicated.  I suggest to use
an illustration to explain the part.

14. Fig 16
I suggest to present pull distributions rather than the residual
distributions because the pull distributions should fluently tell how
the estimated statistical errors are correct.

15. Line 1067
Does a fit bias exist in the fit?  If yes, is it included into
non-reducible uncertainties (I think a fit bias is non-reducible)?

16. Paragraph starting from L1098
This is another difficult paragraph to me to understand.  I suggest to
start with the strategy to discuss the sensitivity.
It should also be needed to give explanation of "x_theo".  Because of
the chi^2 includes the "x_theo", the chi^2 looks dependent on some
theory models, which made me difficult to proceed with the following
sections.

l.740 “l.h.s” means what?

l.754 B0 -> pi0 pi0 branching fraction and CP asymmetry measurements
are published as PRD96, 032007.

l.758 “in accordance with” may be grammatically correct.

l.772 strictly speaking, “.. ruled out by the measurement of $\phi_1$
assuming that CKM unitarity triangle.” may be correct.

l.835 what is $\pi^3$ ?

l.856 “.. 2nd order effects does not guarantee that ..” may be
grammatically correct.

l.886 Generic should be written in roman font.

l.896 photon conversion in one of the SVD layers still help to carry
out time-dependent CP violation measurement in B0 -> pi0 pi0 decays,
why such possibility is ignored?

l.904 and many places, it seems that in order to express invariant mass
cut for event selection, you use “constraint” as the wording, but
usually "mass constraint” means "mass constraint fit is performed” so
your expression is quite misleading or confusing, I am afraid. I think
that “mass window” or “requiring the invariant mass within XX\sigma
around the nominal mass” would be more appropriate wordings to avoid
unnecessary confusion.

Fig. 11 “htemp” is there in the legend of the plot, could you tidy up it?

l.911 Is “a PID $\cal{L}(e)$ > 0.8” well explained in reconstruction
section? Otherwise it looks just a jargon and necessary to be rephrased. 

l.917 Does “the mass of the reconstructed $\gamma_{\rm c}$ is set to be
zero.” mean “the $\gamma_{\rm c}$ momentum is obtained by the momentum
sum of $e^+$ and $e^-$ tracks.” ?

l.918 “The reconstruction of neutral pions with ..”

l.935-l.936 The description around here seems to be duplicated in the
sentences in l.953-l.955 and the latter is written in more quantitative
way, maybe we should reconsider to refine the organization of these
paragraphs.

l.940 To me, it is uneasy to follow what “.., giving the priority to
candidates with reconstructed Dalitz $\pi^0_{\rm dal}.$ means.

l.950 Does this sentence means “When the two daughter $\pi^0$s are
reconstructed from the photon pairs detected as ECL clusters, there is
no event overlap with the $B^0 \to \pi^0_{\rm dal} \pi^0_{\gamma
\gamma}$ case.” ? Current expression is not so easy for me to catch the
meaning.

l.960 Is $\Delta l$ commonly accepted variable? I think the two $B$
meson’s vertex displacement in $z$ direction, $\Delta z$ is the directly
measured variable to obtain $\Delta t$.

l.963 Is “0.2 ps larger” correct? Looking at Fig. 12, "0.3 ps larger”
seems to be correct.

l.989 I suggest “In this case, the $B$ decay vertex is only a few
microns away from the IP in $r-\phi$ plane, then immediate $\pi^0$ decay
follows, therefore the angles ..” 

l.1001- The expression of continuum suppression looks repeated in
mode-by-mode manner, but it may be worth to think about writing common
methods in detail somewhere in other section(s) in the paper, I feel.

l.1043 and Table 19 caption, The explanation of $n_{\rm combin}$ is
totally confusing. I think “wrongly reconstructed signal” means the
signal B decay but at least one of the daughter particle is taken from
other B decay products, i.e. signal but reconstructed by wrong final
state particle combination, combinatorial background is one of random
combination of final state particles comes into the event selection
window in the background events in which there is no signal B decay.
To me $n_{\rm cont}$ sounds the combinatorial background from continuum
events.

l.1053 Is Delta Spi0pi0 = 0.29 is adequate to reject unfavored solution
of phi2? If yes, such impact of this work is better to be mentioned.

Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 I think the vertical axis should not be “Events/0.02”
but “Number of pseudo-experiments/0.02” or something like that.

l.1072 For +-3.18% and +-0.415%, the third digit does not have positive
meaning, why not +-3.2% and 0.42%?

l.1079 For +-0.29+-0.03, +-0.03 is error of error, I don’t think it has
positive meaning, let’s drop it.

l.1083 Belle B0 -> rho+rho- analysis published as PRD 93, 032010 (2016)
seems to be ignored, why?

l.1092 +-1.02 for C_rho+rho-, it sounds so large, why?

l.1140 Br(B0 -> pi0pi0) was adjusted to be 1.27 \times 10^-6, what is
the motivation to do this?

l.1025 and equation 29, as for \phi_d and \sin 2 \beta, please consider
about unified notation thorough out the paper.

Theory:
--------
l.34 “.. while the corresponding decay width can be ..” it is not clear
what is the corresponding decay width.

l.116 Is the $A_{u, c}$ definition explained somewhere?

l.129 I prefer to use the wording which sounds positively, 
“This problem is to be overcome with high-luminosity experiments like
Belle II as discussed in section 1.2.2.” or something like that.

l.283 Is "$\cal{O}(|\epsilon_{uc} r^T_f|, |r^{\rm NP}_f|)$” widely
accepted expression?

l.303 why ref. 35 is separately cited as “(see also [35])”? [14, 33, 34, 35]
may be natural expression, I feel.

l.308 Is “$\cal{O}(\alpha_s ; \Lambda/m_B)$” widely accepted expression?

l.347 It should be $\cal{A}_{3/2}$.

l.349 Does $\gamma \to - \gamma$ mean “$\phi_3 \to - \phi_3$”?

l.357 “.. (Figure 4 left).”

l.362 “.. solutions in the Figure.” To me, it is unclear which figure is
mentioned.

l.373 “.. nominal size $\cal{O}(20\%)$.” Is this 20% for what? Branching
fraction or CP asymmetry?

l.374- Here, b \to q\bar{q}s penguin modes are written as “complementary ways
to access \phi_1” in the SM”, but it is more common to say that b \to
q\bar{q}s penguin modes CP violation is in order for look for the significant
or substantial deviation with respect to the CP violation in b \to c\bar{c}s
transition, isn’t it? 

- section 1.2.1 (theory)
The discussion of theoretical assumptions in different estimates
of DeltaS is not very transparent… (for an experimentalist reader, at least)
in particular it is not clear if some of the quoted theoretical models
may be constrained by additional measurements.

Others:

17. Line 1251
It might be kind of you if you could give definition of the "p-value".
It took a couple of minutes to me to remind it...

18.  Fig 25
As like as Figures 6 and 12, I suggest to fit the distribution with
three Gaussian distributions rather than two.

19. Line 1302
Please give the definition of the "SCET" in the document.

There seems to be many places where notation should be revisited to be
written in the unified definition throughout the paper.
\sin 2 \phi_1 or \sin( 2 \phi_1 ) or \sin 2 \beta ?
B^0 or B_d or B ?
SU(3) or $SU(3)$ ?
and so on. 
Also, in order to mention about equation, I prefer "eq. ( number )" than
"( number )”. Such treatment should be unified throughout this paper
including other sections. For example , l.199, “using (11)” I prefer
“using eq. (11)”, otherwise, it is unclear what is pointed.

l.1223 “All these make this approach challenging.” is correct expression?

l.1237 “.. left unconstrained” but in other places, “Generic decay” is
used as the wording to express same meaning, please consider about unified
terminology through out the paper.

Fig.21 Is it general gamma, or the prompt gamma emitted from the signal
B decay?

l.1250, l.1260 and l.1264 I am afraid “Kfit" and “RaveFit” are jargons, are
they well explained in the reconstruction chapter?

l.1266 “Given the significant flight length of the B0 candidates” I think
it is true in the LHC experiments where originally Rave was developed, but
in the energy-asymmetric e+e- B-factories, the B decay vertex position
resolution is about 1/3 of B meson lifetime, “significant flight length” is
not true. In such point of view, as for explanation about Rave algorithm,
I like to ask you to improve expressions around here.

Fig.24 it must be enlarged, otherwise fonts on vertical and horizontal
axises are too small to read. 

l.1295 just a comment, by the way, even if KS decays outside SVD volume,
such events can still be added in the unbinned maximum likelihood fit by
time-integrated PDF to help to constrain A_CP=-C_CP.

l.1302 I am afraid “SCET” is a jargon, please add some words to explain
what it is.

l.1317 Would notation become $\sin 2 \phi_1$  ?

l.1337 the tension for S_pi0pi0 is not obvious by seeing Fig. 19.

(1) In the introduction the CKM triangle angles, the CP observables (asymmetries),
and the CP asymmetry parameters extracted from a fit are quoted
with numerical results before being explicitly defined
and referring to tables located at the end of the chapter.
Lines 16-28 and 50-54, reporting these results for phi_1,
seem more appropriate for the conclusions and
could be moved to section 1.6.

(2) One should avoid a confusion in terminology
among “CP observables” (“CP asymmetries” a_CP),
“CP parameters” S, A extracted from fits,
and their CKM interpretation in terms of phi_1 and phi_2.
(Sometimes S is called “CP asymmetry”, etc.)

(3) The introduction is supposed to be a general introduction?
apparently the determination of phi_2 is given less emphasis
with respect to phi_1, that has several paragraphs devoted
to an anticipation of quantitative extrapolation results.

- section 1.5.2 (experiment, B -> KS0 pi0 gamma), lines 1225-1314
The quoted reconstruction efficiency (Table 23) and sensitivity for S, A parameters
seem to be based only on a signal MC sample: they look unrealistic,
since selection criteria will be probably tightened to cope with backgrounds
and there will be dilution factors due to backgrounds in the selected sample.
Apparently, systematic uncertainties are not included in the extrapolation.
Are these results too preliminary to be included?

- section 1.6 (conclusions)
The text should highlight some of the most relevant results on projected sensitivities
from Tables 26, 27 etc.: in particular lines 16-28 and 50-54 from the introduction
should rather be moved to the conclusions.
The conclusions do not include any statement on the results for K0S pi0 gamma:
is this because the analysis is too preliminary? should it be included at all?
